## QR-CODE-COMPONENT FRONTEND MENTOR TAILWIND
There's not much to say about this simple exercise, besides that I played around a bit with Tailwind at first, made the whole thing look pretty similar to the image and then figured out that there was a font-weight, size and family that I had to use... 

Sadly now when I try to implement those on my code, it looks pretty bad, so I left it as it is without importing the font-family or setting the given font-size.
